# Joint_Savings_Account

In this code I create a smart contract with Solidity to function as a joint savings account.

---

## Technologies

This code was written on Windows 11 running Solidity (0.5.0).
---

## Installation Guide

Solidity is the native language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It can be coded natively in Remix ide. To use the Remix ide either visit there website here: <https://remix.ethereum.org> or download the desktop app from there github here: <https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases>

## Usage

To interact with this contract you must first compile it and then deploy it into a test enviornment. I used the Remix VM (London). Once it is dployed you can deposit to the contract, set the two accounts to withdraw to, and then withdraw funds to either one. There are also functions for checking the last withdrawal amount and address, as well as the remaining balance of the contract. Here is a screenshot of what you will see interacting with the contract through the Remix IDE.
